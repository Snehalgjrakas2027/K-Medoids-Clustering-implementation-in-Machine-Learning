# ðŸ§© K-Medoids Clustering in Machine Learning

This project implements the **K-Medoids Clustering algorithm**â€”a robust unsupervised learning method used to partition data into clusters based on medoid points, which are actual data points (unlike centroids in K-Means). K-Medoids is particularly effective when dealing with **noisy data** or **non-Euclidean distance metrics**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Implement the **K-Medoids algorithm** from scratch or using `scikit-learn`-compatible libraries
- Visualize clustering results on 2D/3D datasets
- Compare performance with **K-Means**, especially in terms of robustness to outliers
- Support custom distance metrics (e.g., Manhattan, Cosine)

## ðŸ§  What is K-Medoids?

- A clustering technique that minimizes the **sum of dissimilarities** (e.g., distances) between points and the medoids of their clusters
- Uses **actual data points** as cluster centers (medoids)
- More **robust to noise and outliers** compared to K-Means
